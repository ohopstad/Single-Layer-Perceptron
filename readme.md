## Single Layer Perceptron

A quick interpretation updating weights with w = l_rate * (target - actual).

The perceptron is one of the earliest machine learning algorithms, which makes it an excelent algorithm to start with. A perceptron can successfully learn any linearly-separable function, the obvious choices being AND, OR, NOT, NOR, NAND. The SLP cannot, however, learn the functions XOR and XNOR, since these are non-linear.
